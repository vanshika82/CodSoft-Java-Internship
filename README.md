# CodSoft-Java-Internship

Here you will find an exciting collection of projects completed during my CodSoft Internship.

# Number Game| Task-1

The "NumberGame" project is a Java Swing-based application that allows users to play a guessing game. The game randomly generates a number within a specified range, and the user has to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is correct, too high or to low.

Features:

1. User Interaction: The game will prompt the player to enter their guess for the secret number.
2. Random Number Generation: The game will generate a random number within a predefined range at the beginning of each round.
3. Guess Validation: The player's input will be validated to ensure it's a valid number within the given range.
4. Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the player will receive feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. 
5. Guess Limit. To add an element of challenge, there will be a limit on the number of guesses the player can make per round.
6. Winning Scenario: The player will be informed when they guess the correct number, along with the number of attempts it took Display the user's score out of 100%, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

# Word Counter | Task-2

The Word Counter Application is a Java project  focuses on developing an application that takes a text input and provides users with valuable insights, such as word and character count. This project will provide a hands-on experience in Java programming and input/output handling.

Features:

1. User Input Options: The application will provide users with two options:
entering text directly.
2. Word Count: The application will analyze the input text, whether entered directly and calculate the total number of words.
3. Character Count: Alongside word count, the application will calculate the total number of characters.
4.  Average Word Length: The application will compute the average length of words in the input text.
5. Most Frequent Words: The application can be expanded to identify and display a list of the most frequently used words in the input text.

# ATM Interface | Task-4

This is a Java Based Project ATM interface when we compile and run it then display ATM INTERFACE. You can interact with the ATM INTERFACE by entering amounts and selecting the desired options.

Features:

1. User Authentication: Users will be prompted to enter a PIN to access their account.
2. Account Balance Inquiry: Once authenticated, users can choose to check their account balance.
3. Cash Withdrawal: Users will be able to withdraw a specified amount of cash from their account, provided they have sufficient funds.
